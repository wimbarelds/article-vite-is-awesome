## Raw Imports

There's a cool feature you get with Vite that few people know about, and I find this is particularly
useful when you're trying to share code / code examples. That feature is "raw imports".

How do you use it? How do you set it up? There isn't actually any setup you need to do. You just add
`?raw` to the import statement. For example:

```ts
import packageJson from './package.json?raw';
import changelog from './CHANGELOG.md?raw';
import viteConfigCode from './vite.config.ts?raw';
```

Just a few examples of how you might use this. The values are automatically typed as `string`, and
when importing with the `?raw` suffix the content of that file is always the "default export". You
can do this with any (text-based) filetype.
