## Minor Disclaimer

I've simplified a few things in the code above. For instance, my actual Material Symbol plugin
caches HTTP requests and includes other tricks for reliability. My real prerender setup is even more
fancy. However, I believe those details would have detracted from the core message:
**Vite is awesome**, and its configuration and plugins are surprisingly simple yet incredibly
powerful.
