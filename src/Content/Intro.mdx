# Vite is Awesome

Before Vite emerged, **Webpack** was the go-to bundler for web development. While widely adopted,
I frequently encountered issues with Webpack. Anytime I sought help, I found most people were
hesitant to modify their Webpack configuration, and few truly understood its inner workings.

My experience with **Vite** has been significantly different.

Recently, I've been incrementally improving a slide deck for a React workshop. These improvements
weren't about content; they focused on the build process, asset loading, and content authoring. For
most of these enhancements, I ended up creating a **Vite plugin**.
