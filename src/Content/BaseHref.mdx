## Base Href

The React workshop is deployed to GitHub Pages, meaning the URL ends up looking something like
`[owner].github.io/[repository]`. This means that files aren't served from the root directory. We
can inform Vite of this with `vite build --base="/repository-name/"`.

While this command sets the base URL, it doesn't automatically add `<base href="/repository-name/">`
to your HTML. I could manually add this to my `index.html`, but then it would also appear in the
HTML when I don't use the `--base` argument. I had some time and a minor inconvenience to scratch,
so I decided to make a plugin for it.

```ts
export function vitePluginBaseHref(): PluginOption {
  const { base = '/' } = minimist(argv.slice(2));

  return {
    name: 'html-basehref',
    config: (current) => ({ ...current, base }), // Set the base public path
    transformIndexHtml: () => [
      {
        // Add the `<base href="/repository-name/">` tag to the HTML
        tag: 'base',
        injectTo: 'head-prepend',
        attrs: { href: base },
      },
    ],
  };
}
```

Again, **EASY!** Not only is the code simple to write, but it's also straightforward to understand,
modify, or extend.
