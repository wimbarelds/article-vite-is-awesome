## Base Href

The React workshop is deployed to GitHub Pages, meaning the URL ends up looking something like
`[owner].github.io/[repository]`. This means that files aren't served from the root directory. We
can inform Vite of this with `vite build --base="/repository-name/"`.

While this command sets the base URL, it doesn't automatically add `<base href="/repository-name/">`
to your HTML. I could manually add this to my `index.html`, but then it would also appear in the
HTML when I don't use the `--base` argument. I had some time and a minor inconvenience to scratch,
so I decided to make a plugin for it.

<Code code={example} />

Again, **EASY!** Not only is the code simple to write, but it's also straightforward to understand,
modify, or extend.
